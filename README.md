## üöÄ Introduction

This project documents the end-to-end creation of a fully functional Security Operations Center (SOC) home lab. Built from the ground up, this lab serves as a practical environment to simulate, detect, and analyze common cyber threats. The primary goal was to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge (from certifications like CompTIA Security+ and Cisco CCNA) and the hands-on, practical skills required for a SOC Analyst (Tier 1) role.

The project covers the complete threat lifecycle: from infrastructure architecture and network engineering to executing a controlled attack, detecting it with a SIEM, and analyzing the results.

## üõ†Ô∏è Lab Architecture

The lab was built on **VMware Workstation Pro** to ensure high performance and stability, after initially diagnosing and resolving critical I/O performance issues encountered with VirtualBox.

### Network Design

To mirror a corporate environment and enforce a "defense-in-depth" strategy, a segmented network was designed using VMware's Virtual Network Editor. This isolates the secure management network from the operational network where attacks are simulated.

*   **Management Network (`VMnet2`):**
    *   **Subnet:** `192.168.56.0/24`
    *   **Description:** A secure, isolated network for managing servers and accessing the Wazuh dashboard.
    *   **Assets:** Wazuh Server (Management Interface), Analyst Workstation.

*   **Operations & Logging Network (`VMnet3`):**
    *   **Subnet:** `192.168.170.0/24`
    *   **Description:** The network for operational endpoints and the attacker machine. It also serves as the channel for agents to forward logs to the Wazuh server's collector interface.
    *   **Assets:** Wazuh Server (Log Collector Interface), Attacker Machine, Victim Machine.

### Asset Inventory

| **Victim Machine** | Windows 10 | `192.168.170.129` | `VMnet3` (Ops) | The target endpoint |

## üõ°Ô∏è Attack & Analysis Scenarios

Two primary scenarios were executed to test the lab's detection and analysis capabilities.

### Scenario 1: Brute-Force Attack Against a Hardened System

This scenario simulates a noisy, unsophisticated attacker attempting to breach a properly configured Windows endpoint.

**1. The Attack (Red Team):**
*   A dictionary-based brute-force attack was launched from the Kali machine using `Hydra` against the victim's RDP service.
*   The attack failed as the target system began refusing connections after a small number of attempts.

**2. The Analysis (Blue Team):**
*   Investigation revealed that the attack was thwarted by a built-in Windows security policy.
*   The system's **Account Lockout Policy** was triggered, locking the target account and preventing any further login attempts. This is a critical defense mechanism against brute-force attacks.
*   The lockout was confirmed by inspecting the user account properties on the victim machine.

**Conclusion:** This demonstrates the effectiveness of modern OS hardening and the importance of proactive security controls. The lab successfully simulated an attack and validated a key defensive measure.

### Scenario 2: Full-Cycle Attack Analysis in a Lab Environment

For deeper analysis, the Account Lockout Policy was temporarily disabled to observe the full lifecycle of a successful brute-force attack.

**1. Environment Modification:**
*   The `Account lockout threshold` was set to `0` in the Local Group Policy Editor, intentionally weakening the system for educational purposes.

**2. The Attack (Red Team):**
*   The `Hydra` attack was re-launched. This time, with the lockout policy disabled, the attack was successful in guessing the correct password.

**3. The Detection (Blue Team):**
*   Wazuh successfully detected and logged the entire attack chain:
    1.  **Initial Failed Logons:** A series of `Windows User Logoff` alerts were generated for the failed attempts.
    2.  **Successful Logon:** Once the password was cracked, Wazuh immediately triggered a high-priority alert for a successful remote desktop logon.
*   **Relevant Wazuh Rules Triggered:**
    *   `Rule 60137`: Windows User Logoff (indicating failed attempts)
    *   `Rule 60204`: User logon using Remote Desktop Connection

**4. Post-Exploitation:**
*   Using the compromised credentials, a successful RDP connection was established from the Kali machine to the victim, confirming full system access.

**Conclusion:** This scenario validates the lab's ability to provide full visibility into an attack chain, from initial attempts to successful compromise, showcasing the SIEM's critical role in threat detection.
